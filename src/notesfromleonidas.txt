// if I want to build a warehouse that can service all the cities
// what is the best place to build the city 
// what gives me the average shortest distance to al lthe other cities
// for every node do BFS 
// get BFS distances to all other nodes, add them up, then divide them by n-1 
// that is the closeness centrality 

implement BFS
use it to calculate the closeness centrality

use DFS to do strongly connected components 

make sure the node IDs are sequential 

    // what's the average length, stnadard deviation??
